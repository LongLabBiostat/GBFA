# Incorporating Graph Information in Bayesian Factor Analysis with Robust and Adaptive Shrinkage Priors (Biometrics, 2024)
Qiyiwen Zhang, Changgee Chang, Li Shen & Qi Long
## Abstract
In this work, we propose a Bayesian factor model with novel hierarchical priors, which incorporate the biological graph knowledge as a tool of identifying a group of genes
functioning collaboratively. The proposed model therefore enables sparsity within networks by allowing each factor
loading to be shrunk adaptively and by considering additional layers to relate individual shrinkage parameters to the
underlying graph information, both of which yield a more accurate structure recovery of factor loadings. Further,
this new priors overcome the phase transition phenomenon, in contrast to existing graph-incorporated approaches, so
that it is robust to noisy edges that are inconsistent with the actual sparsity structure of the factor loadings. Finally,
our model can handle both continuous and discrete data types.
